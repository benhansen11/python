### Hi! Thank you for checking out my project. This is a sample Python and SQL project that I created to practice my skills and further my knowledge in OOP. I created a menu for a restaurant using python functions and SQLite for a database. You have the ability to add a name, a food item, and change the order after placing it. I'm still currently working on other features that give the user more freedom with their order and prices. I also plan on adding a feature that allows the user to delete their order and start over if they cahnge their mind.
